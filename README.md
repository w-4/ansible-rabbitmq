# Stone Payments - RabbitMQ

Ansible role to install and configure RabbitMQ server.

## Note

A good practice is to have, before using this, clear knowledge of what are the plugins you're going to need. By default, this role enables the management plugin, here is a example of a playbook that enables more plugins.

```yaml
---
- name: queue service
  hosts: your_hosts
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: stone-payments.rabbitmq
      rabbitmq_plugins:
        - rabbitmq_management
        - rabbitmq_shovel
        - rabbitmq_shovel_management
```

## Requirements

To install requirements you can run this command: `pipenv install --dev`

Before using this role make sure that the machines that will compose the cluster connect to each other - via ping or name resolution. Also make sure that they can connect to the Internet to download RabbitMQ package.

For RedHat machines make sure the machines are subscribed. Also, this role requires the previous installation of the EPEL repositories. Alternatively, you can use our role [stone-payments.epel](https://github.com/stone-payments/ansible-epel) to install EPEL.

## How to run this?

### Example Playbook

```yaml
  - hosts: servers
    roles:
      - stone-payments.rabbitmq
```

By default this role will install the currently last upstream version of RabbitMQ (which is 3.8.5). If you want to install any other version you must give the version numbers.

```yaml
  - hosts: servers
    roles:
      - role: stone-payments.rabbitmq
        rabbitmq_major: 3
        rabbitmq_minor: 8
        rabbitmq_patch: 5
```

By default the role will try the configure the NODENAME with `rabbit@{{ ansible_nodename }}` when clustering is enabled, if you want to customize the node name, you can substitute the NODENAME with the variables `rabbitmq_nodename_prefix`.

Others specific RabbitMQ environment variables can also be given.

```yaml
  vars:
    rabbitmq_conf_env:
      RABBITMQ_NODE_IP_ADDRESS: "127.0.0.2"
```

You can alter:

- Memory watermark (`rabbitmq_conf_disk_free_limit_mem_relative`);
- Free disk space limit (`rabbitmq_conf_vm_memory_high_watermark`);
- Number of system's open files (`rabbitmq_system_number_open_files`).

```yaml
  vars:
    rabbitmq_conf_disk_free_limit_mem_relative: 1.5
    rabbitmq_conf_vm_memory_high_watermark: 0.4
    rabbitmq_system_number_open_files: 50000
```

To create a cluster you just have to run this role against the target nodes and give some extra vars.

```yaml
- name: queue service clustered
  hosts: group2
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: stone-payments.rabbitmq
      rabbitmq_erlang_cookie: <your_cookie>
      rabbitmq_clustering_enabled: true
```

To create a cluster using FQDN for hosts, just set USE_LONGNAME.

```yaml
  vars:
    rabbitmq_conf_env:
      USE_LONGNAME: "true"
```

Notice that the cookie is hash string that can be of any size. A good practice is use a hash of 20 characters. This is the syncronization cookie used by erlang to create the cluster.

Use this [playbook](playbook.yml) as a practical example.

## Testing

This role implements unit tests with [`molecule`](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`testinfra`](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Notice that we only support Molecule 2.0 or greater. You can install molecule with:

```shell
pipenv install --dev --three
```

After having Molecule setup, you can run the tests with this steps:

```sh
molecule test [-s scenario_name]
```

## To Do

- Add tests for the conection/read/write of rabbit's queues
- Test removing flush_handlers from clustering step
- Bug: when the master is down and the clustering step is run all the other nodes will go down.
